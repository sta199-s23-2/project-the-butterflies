    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\nHow do various college basketball playing statistics influence players’ NBA draft pick? Which statistic (efficiency rating, total points, shooting percentage, etc) is the best predictor of being a #1 or top 10 pick in the NBA draft?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThe research topic is performance statistics of players in college basketball and the potential association with draft picks. We hypothesize that efficiency rating will be the best predictor of draft pick with a higher efficiency rating predicting a lower numerical draft pick. Performance statistics to be considered were chosen based on general basketball knowledge and will be tested using linear regression models.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThe majority of the variables are quantitative such as average or total points, steals, blocks, etc but there are also some categorical variables, such as year in school, team, and conference. For the response variable ‘pick’, observations with ’NA’s will be removed from the data set."

One of the models included data for the players from only that season before the draft in question, while the other model included data of every season the player played in college before entering the draft. One strong predictor these models found was age, with freshman predicted and actually drafted higher on average and players drafted lower each subsequent year. However, one problem the article mentions in using college statistics to predict NBA draft picks is that because many prospects are drafted based on potential, there were often freshman with worse statistics that were drafted higher because NBA teams may have believed they had underdeveloped talent, as opposed to players with better statistics who the NBA teams may have viewed as having already reached their peak ability.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question is different than the article because it includes many more extensive variables than mentioned in the article, such as breaking down shots by dunks, rim shots, and midrange shots, along with categorizations such as conference which may influence players’ success, so we will be able to look for more potential specific trends based on the numerous variables available."

Griffin.\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nThere are 15 columns and 271,116 rows. Each row repesents a different olympic athlete throughout the history of the olympics, while each column represents a different variable about that athlete, like year, country, medal, etc."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\nHow do factors like age, height, and weight correlate with medal success rate across the different sports?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nFor this research topic, we would have to take a look at which ages, heights, and weights have received medals. I would hypothesize that for each separate sport, there is a different normal distribution for ages, heights, and weights that have medal success rates, with an ideal age, height, and weight for each individual sport.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nMy research question would involve the age (quantitative), height (quantitative), weight (quantitative), sport (categorical), and medal (categorical).\nLiterature\n\nFind one published credible article on the topic you are interested in researching.\n\nhttps://slate.com/culture/2016/08/why-female-gymnasts-are-so-short.html\n\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\n\nThis article talks about the fact that the average height of Olympic female gymnasts have been getting shorter. 30 years ago, they were about 5 foot 3, but today they average out at about 4 foot 9. This is due to the fact of the advantage in gymnastics of being short. With a lower center of inertia, a higher power-weight ratio, and an easier time rotating in the air, it makes sense that gymnasts are better off smaller. The article finishes off by questioning if the average height will continue to decrease.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThis talks about the average height for womens gymnastics. Our research question is different because we will be looking at which heights have the higher medal success rate, not just which heights exist in the olympics. Hopefully, by taking into account the earned medals, we will depict an even more accurate understanding of which heights are most likely to succeed."
